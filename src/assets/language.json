    "ch1_conch-review-2": "Not bad. Now what could be a <span class='color sm-q'>scientific question</span> I could ask based on these <span class='color sm-o'>observations</span>?",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q1": "Why is the deep ocean so dark?",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q1-1": "Good start, but it needs to be more specific.",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q1-2": "Try using variables in your <span class='color sm-q'>question</span>: the things that you observe changing.",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q2": "How does color of the ocean change with depth?",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q2-1": "Much better, but color can sometimes be subjective.",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q2-2": "Hmm, if we used a different variable, something less subjective...",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q3": "How about the amount of sunlight?",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q3-1": "Yes, that works! How does the amount of sunlight change with depth in the ocean?",
    "ch1_conch-review-2_q3-2": "Now that is a question that relates to your <span class='color sm-o'>observations</span>, is specific, and can be measured.",
    "ch1_conch-review-3": "Nice work.",

    "ch1_conch-review-4": "These are examples of qualitative data: descriptions about things that are observed, but not measured precisely.",
    "ch1_conch-review-5": "It's a good start, ",

    "ch1_conch-encounter-5_o3": "What is qualitative data?",
    "ch1_conch-encounter-5_o3-1": "Qualitative data are descriptions about things that are observed, but not measured precisely."
